# Course UI Task

This is a simple UI task where everything is hardcoded, including the user authentication details.

## Credentials
To log in, use the following credentials:
- **Email:** admin@gmail.com
- **Password:** 123456

## Notes
- All data displayed in this project is **hardcoded**.
- The design might not be the best. I sincerely **apologize** for that, as I didn't have a Figma design or any UI reference to follow.
- I did my best with the available resources and time.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EyadAymanM/course-ui-task.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd course-ui-task
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the project:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Contributing
This was just a quick task, but feel free to fork and improve the design if needed!
